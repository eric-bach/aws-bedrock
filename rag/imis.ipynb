    "In the above scenario you explored the quick and easy way to get a context-aware answer to your question. Now let's have a look at a more customizable option with the helpf of [RetrievalQA](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/index_examples/vector_db_qa.html) where you can customize how the documents fetched should be added to prompt using `chain_type` parameter. Also, if you want to control how many relevant documents should be retrieved then change the `k` parameter in the cell below to see different outputs. In many scenarios you might want to know which were the source documents that the LLM used to generate the answer, you can get those documents in the output using `return_source_documents` which returns the documents that are added to the context of the LLM prompt. `RetrievalQA` also allows you to provide a custom [prompt template](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/prompt_templates/getting_started.html) which can be specific to the model.\n",

    "Note: In this example we are using Anthropic Claude as the LLM under Amazon Bedrock. This particular model [performs best](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/human-and-assistant-formatting) if the inputs are provided under `Human:` and the model is requested to generate an output after `Assistant:`. In the cell below you see an example of how to control the prompt such that the LLM stays grounded and doesn't answer outside the context."
